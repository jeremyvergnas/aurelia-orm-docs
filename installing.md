# Installing

Head over to your terminal of choice, and navigate to your project.
Now run the following command:

`jspm i aurelia-orm aurelia-api`

This will install aurelia-orm and [aurelia-api](https://github.com/SpoonX/aurelia-api).

## Configuring

Aurelia-orm uses [aurelia-api](https://github.com/SpoonX/aurelia-api) to talk to the server. By default, it will communicate with the domain you're hosting your app on. If you wish to change the endpoints used, you should take a look at configuring aurelia-api.
